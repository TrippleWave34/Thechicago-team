            <h2> <strong>1. The Dream Team Vibes</strong></h2>
            <p> When people talk about the greatest basketball squads ever assembled, the 1992 U.S. Olympic "Dream Team" gets all the love‚Äîand rightfully so. 
            But in the NBA, the Chicago Bulls of the 90s were the Dream Team. 
          
    <p> With Michael Jordan leading the charge, Scottie Pippen as his reliable wingman, 
        and coach Phil Jackson pulling the strings like a Zen master, the Bulls were a force of nature. 
    Their chemistry, dominance, and global impact rivaled the Olympic legends. 
    MJ and Pippen arent just teammates they were synchronized artists on the hardwood, redefining what winning looked like.</p>

    <h3><strong>2. Humble Beginnings</strong></h3>
    <p> Before the dynasty, the Bulls were just another team trying to stay relevant. Michael Jordan was drafted in 1984, and it didnt take long for him to become a superstar. </p>
    <p>Still, the Bulls weren't winning titles. The Pistons bullied them in the late '80s, and critics said MJ couuld't win without help. Enter Scottie Pippen.</p>
    <p>Drafted in 1987, he wasn't a ready-made star, but he grew into the perfect counterpart. With Pippen's defensive prowess and unselfish playstyle, the foundation of something special was set in motion.</p>

    <h3><strong>3. The Rise of a Dynasty</strong></h3>
    <p>From 1991 to 1993, the Bulls went on a tear, winning three straight championships. MJ was electric, Pippen was quietly dominant, 
        and role players like Horace Grant and John Paxson did their jobs to perfection.</p>
    <p> Then came MJ's first retirement‚Äîa gut punch to fans everywhere. 
        But he returned in 1995, hungry. What followed was another three-peat from 1996 to 1998, featuring a new cast: Dennis Rodman's wild energy, 
        Steve Kerr's clutch shooting, and the ever-evolving Triangle Offense. The Bulls werent just good‚Äîthey were a global phenomenon.</p>

    <h3><strong>4. The Last Dance</strong></h3>
        <p>By 1998, cracks had started to show. Tension between management and the players brewed behind the scenes. 
            Jerry Krause, the Bulls' GM, wanted to rebuild‚Äîeven if it meant breaking up the dynasty</p>
        <p>Phil Jackson was told it would be his last season. MJ made it clear: no Phil, no him. 
           And so, after clinching their sixth title in eight years with that iconic Game 6 shot over Bryon Russell, the Bulls' run was over.</p>
    <p>Jordan retired (again), Pippen was traded, and the team faded into memory. But that era? Untouchable. It wasn't just basketball‚Äîit was cultural history.</p>
